Baroque Art,"Italian Caravaggio whose realistic Chiaroscuro style was a breakthrough form of art all over Europe, was the founder of the Baroque that replaced the Mannerism by the end of 16th century. Apart from religious paintings, the Baroque period also saw the emergence of worldly depictions such as the genre paintings and landscapes. The influence of the High Renaissance was still evident as far as style was concerned; however, it was clearly much more rampant in the theatrical arts. Peter Paul Rubens is at the centre stage of the Flemish Baroque paintings and Rembrandt is at the heart of the Dutch paintings. Other famous representatives of Baroque paintings are Vermeer, José de Ribera, Jan van Delft und Diego Velázquez.",2

Expressionism,"Expressionism began more specifically by the artist group “Die Brücke”, that was founded in 1905 and had renowned artists like Kirchner, Heckel, Schmidt-Rottluff and Bleyl. In contrast to Impressionism, the goal of Expressionism was the artistic expression of the inner soul, which was characterized by powerful contours, expressive lines and abstract simplification of objects. In 1911, Wassily Kandinsky formed the artist group “Der blaue Reiter” together with Franz Marc; later on, August Macke, Paul Klee and other artists also joined this group. The objective of this group was to extend the existing boundaries of artistic expression; it was thus that the foundation of abstract painting was laid. German Expressionism was declared as degenerate art in the Third Reich.",8
Futurism,"Futurism deals with the Italian art movement at the beginning of the 20th century; five famous painters were a part of this movement: Boccioni, Carrà, Russolo, Balla and Severini. The objective of this movement was an artistic reproduction of the dynamism of time so that its central themes consisted of the emergence of a mass society, the metropolis and the speed of traffic. Techniques such as Divisionism (decomposition of colour coat in small, juxtaposed dots) and Cubism were applied to achieve this objective.",9
Gothic Art,"This epoch originated in 1140/50 in Ile-de-France and it replaced the Romanic art. There was a refinement and sophistication of art through the Gothic, which was achieved by moving lines, vivid colours and inclination towards naturalism and realism of figural paintings. The 14th and the 15th centuries saw an emergence of “middle-class” themes such as portrait and landscape painting. The Gothic was replaced by the Renaissance at the end of 15th century. Simone Martini, Meister Francke und Gentile da Fabriano are main representatives of the Gothic style.",10

Impressionism,"Impressionism developed in 1860/70 in France and it spread widely throughout Europe. It deals with new and revolutionary modes of painting with central focus on colour. The plein air paintings also emerged during this period, where the effect of the incidence of light plays a decisive role. Manet, Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas or Renoir were some of the famous artists of the Impressionism. Cézanne and van Gogh also belong to the same period. The famous German artists of this period were Liebermann, Slevogt and Corinth.",12
Art Nouveau,"The main period of the Art Nouveau spans over the last decade of the 19th century up to the year 1914. The connection to nature is evident in the paintings of the Art Nouveau period. Stylistic elements such as decorative and flowing lines, floral ornaments, geometric shapes and use of symbolic figures were applied in the images; and fantasy and sensuality were in focus. Animals were also portrayed in a number of paintings of the Art Nouveau along with the floral motifs; true to the motto “nature as role model”. Gustav Klimt, Ferdinand Hodler, Charles Rennie, Mackintosh and Albert von Keller are the main representatives of the Art Nouveau.",1
Modernism,"It is difficult to describe the Classic modern as an independent style. Under the term 'Classic modern"" one understands the artistic innovations at the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century, which are called as “lasting values” in the history of art. Especially, the works of Expressionism (August Macke, Franz Marc, Amadeo Modigliani, Egon Schiele and Richard Gerstl), Cubism and Futurism (Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Fernand Leger, Giacomo Balla), the highlights from Dada and Surrealism are considered as works of the Classic modern.",14
Classicism,"Classicism spread from 1750 to the early years of 1800 in Europe and North America. It was characterized by the emulation of Greco-roman forms. The neoclassical artists tried to replace the triviality of the Rococo style with a style that was logical, earnest and preachy in character. Christian Gottlieb Schick, Ferdinand Kobell, Josef Grassi and Anselm Feuerbach are the prominent representatives of Classicism.",5
Cubism,"Cubism is based on the form principles of late Cézannes, whose creative goal was to capture nature with the use of cylinder, ball and cone forms. Picasso began Cubism with his painting “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon” made in the year 1907. Natural objectivity lost its significance during Cubism. The colour scale was reduced and the shapes were split in angular facets. Besides Picasso, Umberto Boccioni und Juan Gris were popular artists of Cubism.",7
Mannerism,"Mannerism refers to an artistic movement that differed from the classic ideals of the Renaissance. This artistic movement took place between 1520 and 1530. Unrealistic colour schemes and excessive spatial construction are the main features of this style. This style is characterized by the tendency towards bizarre and conscious mysteriousness that is often understood as an expression of fear and an internal social conflict that was very different from the medieval world of beliefs. El Greco, Angelo Bronzino, Domenico Beccafumi, Jacopo Pontormo and Jacopo Tintoretto are the renowned artists of Mannerism.",13
Naïve Art,"“Naive art” is a collective term for the artistic works of autodidacts and laymen that is not motivated intellectually but it often has a subconscious symbolic character. The style is usually simplistic e.g. without use of shadows and with a simple representation of living things and objects. “Naive art” became very popular thanks to extensive travel exhibitions arranged in Paris and in Zurich under the title “Maîtres populaires”. Henri-Julien-Félix Rousseau is the most famous representative of this style. Famous artists like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró or Paul Klee have also incorporated the elements of “Naive art” in their work to some extent.",15

Post-Impressionism,"Pointillism as the “Post impressionism” is a French painting style around the year 1885. Its main representatives Georges Seurat and Camille Pissarro created a new painting technique: They decomposed every colour shade into small dots of complementary colours. Blue next to orange; red next to green and yellow next to violet. They created vibrating light and reinforced the radiant effect by applying contrasts. Hence, Pointillism is sometimes also called as Divisionism.",18
Pop Art,"Pop Art refers to a neo-realist style that emerged in USA and England in the 50s. Sometimes, Pop Art is also called as “anti-art”. This type of art saw the assortment of ordinary mass consumption objects that lifted the boundary between art and the reality of everyday life. Trivial things were portrayed as art and displayed to the viewer. Artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein are representatives of Pop Art. The artists in other countries too worked on new motifs of Pop Art and modified them in different ways from region to region. In Japan, e.g., the influences of the classic Japanese comic called Manga were applied to create Pop Art.",17
Realism,"Realism is a type of representation that begins with the observation of the physical world. It is usually applied in the same sense as the concept of “Naturalism”; however, the difference lies therein that Naturalism refers to an enhanced Realism that is limited to reproduction of nature in its detail. All through the history of art, there have been recurring periods of Realism. Menzel, Courbet, Corot and Fattori are the representatives of Realism.",19
Renaissance,"The Renaissance period replaced the art of the Gothic period. It began in Italy and spread all over Europe by the end of the 15th century. This epoch is classified in the Early renaissance of the 1420s, the High renaissance by the beginning of 16th century and the Late renaissance that lasted till 1520/30 and it was followed by Mannerism. The highlight of this epoch was the revival of the classical antiquity and the antique world of shapes and forms as well as the nude works that were considered taboo in the Medieval period; however, religious art was still considered supreme. Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Tizian, Albrecht Dürer and Raffael are the most popular representatives of the Renaissance.",20
Rococo Art,"The Rococo is a style of European art that existed from 1730 to 1780 and developed from the Late Baroque. The heavy and pathetically pompous forms of the Baroque were transformed into light, disintegrated, soft and delicate forms in the Rococo period. Worldly themes such as festivals or pastoral scenes were prevalent in the Rococo paintings and religious paintings of the Baroque were pushed into the background to a large extent. François Boucher, Thomas Gainsborough and Antoine Watteau are the famous representatives of the Rococo period. The era of Classicism during 1760 to 1800 replaced the Rococo.",21
Romantic Art,"Romanticism replaced the Enlightenment and Classicism at the turn of the 19th century. Caspar David Friedrich was the main representative of Romanticism in Germany; Joseph Mallard William Turner was dedicated to this style of painting in England. The concept “romantic” became the symbol for everything intuitive and emotional; it stood in contrast to rational representation. George Stubbs, Carl Spitzweg and John Constable are the famous representatives of Romanticism.",22

Surrealism,"Surrealism was used for the first time in year 1917 by author Apollinaire for an artistic movement that aimed at “hyper-realism”. The movement led by Breton since 1921 in Paris searched the actual reality of the human being in the sub- consciousness and in ecstasy or dream experiences. It was oriented to the psychoanalysis of Freud that was applied by the artists as a source of inspiration. Dali, Chagall and Miró are the famous artists belonging to Surrealism. This movement spread worldwide but lost its significance after 1945; and the techniques and methods of Surrealism were then incorporated into other styles.",24
Symbolism,"Symbolism refers to an artistic approach that is characterized by protest against the established artistic perceptions like Rationalism, Realism or Naturalism. Symbols were used as a means of expression that created mystic and religious connotations. Thus contents such as death and eros became the main themes for symbolists. The main followers of Symbolism were Arnold Böcklin, Ferdinand Hodler, Odilon Redon and Franz von Stuck.",25
Vintage Posters,"The word ""Vintage"" is an English word and it means antique, respected, classic and exquisite; and it is used for graphics and illustrations created in the look of the period between 1930 to 1970 (or those developed during this period). A recollection of good old times is not the only reason for the popularity of Retro- and Vintage art but it is also popular due to the high quality of craftsmanship of the illustrators and a superior mix of style elements such as e.g. floral Art Nouveau motifs or two dimensional Pop-Art impressions. The collection of Vintage- and Retro art displayed here includes illustrations of European and American artists focusing mainly on Vintage travel- and advertising posters.",26
